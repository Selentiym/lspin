L !type of the basis. L for L-spinors and P for Laguerre polynomials
80 !length of basis for ONE component. So the full basis length is 2*N
-1.0  !kappa
1.0  !Z
-1.0 !scale. basis is L(scale * r), scale is traditionally represented as 2*lambda -1 => scale=Z
1.0 !offset for the quadrature rule
-1 !number of the first basis function, integer. -1 => offset=1 for kappa
